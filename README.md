# Leap Years

A year is a leap year when it is a multiple of 4 but not a multiple of 100 unless it is a multiple of 400. This program prints out the output whether a year is a leap year or not.

# Functionality

The program checks for the user input and determines whether the number is a leap year. The program is efficient as there are no math calculations involved. The program is easy to debug if there is any errors &#x2013; if a number you entered is giving a wrong output, you can jump to the line number corresponding to the input and correct it to the right output instead.

# Limitations

This program only checks for years up to 2100. Why would you care about years after 2100? You are not going to be alive then. I won't be around to see you prove me wrong either.
